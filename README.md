# IRT-Inspired Knowledge Tracing

The code in this repository used to implement the knowledge tracing methods proposed in "Incorporating Item Response Theory into Knowledge Tracing," presented at the Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) 2021. This architecture incorporates the ML2P model from IRT into the knowledge tracing framework, yielding an explicit representation of student knowledge &theta.
