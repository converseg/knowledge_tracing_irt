# IRT-Inspired Knowledge Tracing

The code in this repository used to implement the knowledge tracing methods proposed in "Incorporating Item Response Theory into Knowledge Tracing," presented at the Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) 2021. This architecture incorporates the ML2P model from IRT into the knowledge tracing framework, yielding an explicit representation of student knowledge.

Experiments were performed using Google Colab. Only the notebook for the Synth-5 data is provided here -- experiments on other datasets were performed in a similar manner. Datasets can be found at:
